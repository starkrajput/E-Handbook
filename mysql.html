                                    Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.
                                <br>
                                An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application
                                <br>
                                Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.
                                There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.
                                <br>

                                Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.
                                <br>
                                Basic concepts of OOPs are:

                                Object
                                Class
                                Inheritance
                                Polymorphism
                                Abstraction
                                Encapsulation
                                <br>
                                like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. 
                                <br>
                                The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components:
                                <br>
                                Runtime Environment
                                API(Application Programming Interface).
                                <br>
                                Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).
                                <br>
                                Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:
                                No explicit pointer
                                <br>
                                Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox.
                                Java Application->JVM->OS
                                <br>
                                Classloader: Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is used to load Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically. It adds security by separating the package for the classes of the local file system from those that are imported from network sources.
                                <br>
                                Bytecode Verifier: It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.
                                <br>
                                Security Manager: It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.
                                <br>
                                Java language provides these securities by default. Some security can also be provided by an application developer explicitly through SSL, JAAS, Cryptography, etc
                                <br>

                                #Java is robust because:
                                <br>
                                <div id="a">
                                    There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
                                    Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.
                                    There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these points make Java robust.
    


                                </div>
                                It uses strong memory management.
                              
                                <br>
                                Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.
                                <br>
                                In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.
                                <br>
                                High-performance : Java bytecode is "close" to native code.
                                <br>
                                Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. RMI and EJB

                                <br>
                                A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. 
                                The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.


                                <br>
                                Java supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management (garbage collection).Class are loaded on demand.
                                <br>
                                GoTo is a statement found in many computer programming languages. It performs a one-way transfer of control to another line of code.Usually it is discouredged.
                                <br>

                                C++ supports multiple inheritance.	Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through class. It can be achieved by using interfaces in java.

                                <br>
                                Operator Overloading
                                    C++ supports operator overloading.	Java doesn't support operator overloading.

                                    <br>
                                Pointers	
                                C++ supports pointers. You can write a pointer program in C++.	Java supports pointer internally. However, you can't write the pointer program in java. It means java has restricted pointer support in java.

                                <br>
                                Compiler and Interpreter	
                                C++ uses compiler only. C++ is compiled and run using the compiler which converts source code into machine code so, C++ is platform dependent.	Java uses both compiler and interpreter. Java source code is converted into bytecode at compilation time. The interpreter executes this bytecode at runtime and produces output. Java is interpreted that is why it is platform-independent.

                                <br>
                                Call by Value and Call by reference	
                                C++ supports both call by value and call by reference.	Java supports call by value only. There is no call by reference in java.

                                <br>
                                Structure and Union
                                    C++ supports structures and unions.	Java doesn't support structures and unions.

                                    <br>
                                Thread Support
                                    C++ doesn't have built-in support for threads. It relies on third-party libraries for thread support.	Java has built-in thread support.

                                    <br>
                                Documentation comment	
                                C++ doesn't support documentation comments.	Java supports documentation comment (/** ... */) to create documentation for java source code.

                                Virtual Keyword
                                    C++ supports virtual keyword so that we can decide whether or not to override a function.	Java has no virtual keyword. We can override all non-static methods by default. In other words, non-static methods are virtual by default.

                                Java always uses a single inheritance tree because all classes are the child of the Object class in Java. The Object class is the root of the inheritance tree in java

                                The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a cross-platformed software development environment that offers a collection of tools and libraries necessary for developing Java-based software applications and applets. It is a core package used in Java, along with the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).

                                To compile:
                                javac Simple.java

                                To execute:

                                class keyword is used to declare a class in Java.
                                public keyword is an access modifier that represents visibility. It means it is visible to all.

                                static is a keyword. If we declare any method as static, it is known as the static method. The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method. The main() method is executed by the JVM, so it doesn't require creating an object to invoke the main() method. So, it saves memory.

                                void is the return type of the method. It means it doesn't return any value.

                                JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

                                1) Classloader
                                Classloader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files. Whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by the classloader. There are three built-in classloaders in Java.
                                <br>
                                Bootstrap ClassLoader: This is the first classloader which is the super class of Extension classloader. It loads the rt.jar file which contains all class files of Java Standard Edition like java.lang package classes, java.net package classes, java.util package classes, java.io package classes, java.sql package classes etc.
                                <br>
                                Extension ClassLoader: This is the child classloader of Bootstrap and parent classloader of System classloader. It loades the jar files located inside $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext directory.
                                <br>
                                System/Application ClassLoader: This is the child classloader of Extension classloader. It loads the classfiles from classpath. By default, classpath is set to current directory. You can change the classpath using "-cp" or "-classpath" switch. It is also known as Application classloader.

                                <br>

                                2) Class(Method) Area
                                Class(Method) Area stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field and method data, the code for methods.
                                <br>
                                3) Heap
                                It is the runtime data area in which objects are allocated.
                                <br>
                                4) Stack
                                Java Stack stores frames. It holds local variables and partial results, and plays a part in method invocation and return.
                                <br>
                                Program Counter Register
                                PC (program counter) register contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.
                                <br>
                                6) Native Method Stack
                                It contains all the native methods used in the application.
                                <br>
                                7) Execution Engine :
                                A virtual processor
                                Interpreter: Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.
                                Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the byte code that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. Here, the term "compiler" refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.
                                <br>
                                JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE : Java Native Interface is a foreign function interface programming framework that enables Java code running in a Java virtual machine to call and be called by native applications and libraries written in other languages such as C, C++ and assembly.

                                <br>
                                8) Java Native Interface
                                Java Native Interface (JNI) is a framework which provides an interface to communicate with another application written in another language like C, C++, Assembly etc. Java uses JNI framework to send output to the Console or interact with OS libraries.

                                these primitive data types don't directly belong to the Integer classes
                                <br>
                                abstraction is furnished by not including pointers in Java.

                                Instance variables are those variables that are accessible by all the methods in the class. They are declared outside the methods and inside the class. These variables describe the properties of an object and remain bound to it at any cost.
                                <br>
                                All the objects of the class will have their copy of the variables for utilization. If any modification is done on these variables, then only that instance will be impacted by it, and all other class instances continue to remain unaffected.
                                <br>
                                Example:

                                class Athlete {
                                public String athleteName;
                                public double athleteSpeed;
                                public int athleteAge;
                                }
                                Local variables are those variables present within a block, function, or constructor and can be accessed only inside them. The utilization of the variable is restricted to the block scope. Whenever a local variable is declared inside a method, the other class methods don’t have any knowledge about the local variable.
                                <br>
                                Example:

                                public void athlete() {
                                String athleteName;
                                double athleteSpeed;
                                int athleteAge;
                                }
                                <br>

                                #Default Values :
                                There are no default values assigned to the variables in java. We need to initialize the value before using it. Otherwise, it will throw a compilation error of (Variable might not be initialized). 
                                But for instance, if we create the object, then the default value will be initialized by the default constructor depending on the data type. 
                                If it is a reference, then it will be assigned to null. 
                                If it is numeric, then it will assign to 0.
                                If it is a boolean, then it will be assigned to false. Etc.



                                <br>
                                First, the Java source code (.java) conversion to byte code (.class) occurs with the help of the javac compiler.

                                A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of the memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.

                                <br>
                                A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.
                                A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.


                                <br>
                                A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable. It is not declared as static.

                                <br>
                                A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.

                                Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
                                Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

                                The byte data type is an example of primitive data type. It isan 8-bit signed two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between -128 to 127 (inclusive). Its minimum value is -128 and maximum value is 127. Its default value is 0.
                                The byte data type is used to save memory in large arrays where the memory savings is most required. It saves space because a byte is 4 times smaller than an integer. It can also be used in place of "int" data type.

                                The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.Its value range is unlimited. It is recommended to use a float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. The float data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency. Its default value is 0.0F.

                                The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. Its value-range lies between '\u0000' (or 0) to '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).The char data type is used to store characters.It is because java uses Unicode system not ASCII code system. The \u0000 is the lowest range of Unicode system.

                        # Object
                        Java Object
                        Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.
                        <br>
                        An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.
                        <br>

                        # Class :
                        <br>
                        Class
                        Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
                        <br>
                        A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.

                        <br>
                        #Inheritance
                        When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

                        <br>
                        #Polymorphism
                        If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.
                        <br>
                        In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

                        <br>

                        #Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
                        <br>
                        In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.



                        <br>
                        #Encapsulation
                        Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
                        <br>
                        A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.


                        <br>

                        #Coupling
                        Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class. It arises when classes are aware of each other. If a class has the details information of another class, there is strong coupling. In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a class, method, and field. You can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because there is no concrete implementation.

                        <br>

                        #Cohesion
                        Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts. The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes and interface. However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces.


                        <br>
                        #Association represents the relationship between the objects. Here, one object can be associated with one object or many objects. There can be four types of association between the objects:
                        <br>
                        One to One

                        # OBJECT :Instance of a class.
                        State: represents the data (value) of an object.
                        <br>
                        Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
                        <br>
                        Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.

                        #CLASS :
                        A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
                        <br>
                        A class in Java can contain:
                        <br>
                        Fields
                        Methods
                        Constructors
                        Blocks
                        Nested class and interface

                        :-Instance variable in Java
                        A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method is known as an instance variable. Instance variable doesn't get memory at compile time. It gets memory at runtime when an object or instance is created. That is why it is known as an instance variable.

                        :-new keyword in Java
                        The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. All objects get memory in Heap memory area.
                        <br>



                        Example :
                        Student s1=new Student();  
                        Student s2=new Student();  
                        s1.insertRecord(111,"Karan");  
                        s2.insertRecord(222,"Aryan");  
                        <br>
                        object gets the memory in heap memory area. The reference variable refers to the object allocated in the heap memory area. Here, s1 and s2 both are reference variables that refer to the objects allocated in memory.

                        What are the different ways to create an object in Java?
                        There are many ways to create an object in java. They are:
                        <br>
                        By new keyword
                        By newInstance() method
                        By clone() method
                        By deserialization
                        By factory method etc.
                        <br>




                        Constructors in Java
                        <br>
                        In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
                        <br>
                        It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.
                        <br>
                        Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
                        <br>
                        It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.
                        <br>

                        There are two types of constructors in Java: no-arg constructor, and parameterized constructor.
                        <br>

                        Rules :
                        Constructor name must be the same as its class name
                        A Constructor must have no explicit return type
                        A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
                        <br>



                        #Default Constr -
                        <br>
                        class Bike1{  
                        //creating a default constructor  
                        Bike1(){System.out.println("Bike is created");}  
                        //main method  
                        public static void main(String args[]){  
                        //calling a default constructor  
                        Bike1 b=new Bike1();  
                        }  
                        }  

                        <br>

                        #Constructor Overloading in Java
                        In Java, a constructor is just like a method but without return type. It can also be overloaded like Java methods.
                        <br>
                        Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task. They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.
